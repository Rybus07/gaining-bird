# ⛳️ Strokes Gained Calculator

This is a simple web app that calculates the **strokes gained** on a golf shot, based on baseline values for different lies and distances. It's built as a portfolio project to demonstrate full-stack development and applied data analysis with real sports data.

---

## 🎯 What It Does

The app allows users to input:
- **Initial shot lie** (e.g., Tee, Fairway, Rough)
- **Initial shot distance** (in yards)
- **Final shot lie** (where the ball ends up)
- **Final shot distance** (how far the ball is from the hole after the shot)

And returns the **strokes gained** value for that individual shot.

## 📊 Data Source

This project uses publicly available data from Kaggle:

**[PGA Tour Strokes Gained Baseline Values](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evancallaghan/pga-tour-strokes-gained-baseline-values)**  
Created by [Evan Callaghan](https://www.kaggle.com/evancallaghan)

The dataset includes baseline strokes gained values for both full shots and putts, based on shot lie and distance to the hole.
